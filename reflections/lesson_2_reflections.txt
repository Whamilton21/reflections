What happens when you initialize a reposition? Why do you need to do it?
 
You make a new bank for information.  It allows you to start working with a blank screen and this repository does not alter other repositories. You need to do this to start a new project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is the middle man between the working area and the repository. I think it offers a nice place to hold all the stuff you are done with but not ready to commit.  It offers a nice place to pause.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	The staging area allows us to see what we have tracked and what we havenâ€™t tracked.  As long as we keep one thing at a time, we should be able to make a commit for each logical step.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would help when you are trying to make new features or solving a problem and do not know if it will work.  Branches allow you to work on the project while still keeping the old one intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams help us visualize the branch structure because we can see what connects and when new branches were made, how they fit together.  Branches allow us to see  where the project diverges and what features are being added.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Merging two branches brings the projects together and allows you to combine different peoples work.  The diagram allows us to see the flow of how things go together and what came before what.
